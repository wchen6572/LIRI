LIRI 

There are four possible Commands: 'concert-this', 'spotify-this-song', 'movie-this', or 'do-what-it-says'

'concert-this' - uses the Bandsintown API to retrive all upcoming concerts for an artist that is searched. 

'spotify-this-song' - uses the Spotify API to retrieve data about the song entered in the search parameter. 

'movie-this' - uses the OMDb API to retreive data about the movie entered in the search parameter. 


'do-what-it-says' - The 'do-what-it-says' command reads the random.txt file and executes 'spotify-this-song' with the song 'I Want It That Way'. It is hard coded but can be changed
